Our version numbering scheme:
- Major numbers indicate significant core changes to the program (such as fundamental structure and design overhauls)
- Minor numbers indicate feature set changes.  Even numbered minor numbers are development versions. Odd numbered are release versions.
- Build numbers are used as a reference to a point in time that the version changed.  This number is independent of both major and minor as well as being distinct between development and release.
